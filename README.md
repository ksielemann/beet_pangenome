# Genomic data of sugar beet and crop wild relatives reveal parental relationships of a tetraploid wild beet

This repository contains scripts relevant for

### employing *k*-mer- and gene-based methods to resolve the parental relationships of the tetraploid wild beet *B. corolliflora*

------------------------------------

Different approaches were developed to investigate the parental relationships of the tetraploid wild beet *B. corolliflora*. The following scripts are provided in this repository:

- trio binning java application:

- k-mer fingerprinting java application:
/polyploid_parental_relations_analyses/SBTTrio/out/artifacts/fingerprinting/SBTTrio.jar

- generate artificial reads:
